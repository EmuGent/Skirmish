Skirmish is my first attempt at building an application from scratch. I wanted to try my hand at building a game demo, so I went with that idea. I picked Love2D because I was into the game Balatro, which uses the engine, and after looking into Balatro modding and the game's code base I became intrigued. 

I already had some Lua experience so I went ahead and tried out making something. The demo isn't anything special, and I would like to continue to work on it sometime in the future.

Here is an example of what the demo looks like (I am not an artist, so I used MS paint to get the basics in):
